Agent - Based on the **Query Tool** data for the last 7 days and our **Brand Artifacts** targets, here's your campaign performance analysis:

## 7-Day Performance Summary
- **Total Spend**: $6,005
- **Total Conversions**: 133
- **Total Revenue**: $11,590

## CPA Performance vs Target
- **Actual CPA**: $45.15 ($6,005 ÷ 133 conversions)
- **Target CPA**: <$50 (from Q4 Media Plan)
- **Status**: ✅ **ON TARGET** - We're $4.85 under target CPA

## Additional Insights
- **ROAS**: 1.93:1 ($11,590 ÷ $6,005)
- **Target ROAS**: 4:1 (from Q4 Media Plan)
- **ROAS Status**: ⚠️ **BELOW TARGET** - We're achieving 48% of our target ROAS

## Recommendation
While CPA performance is strong, the low ROAS (1.93:1 vs 4:1 target) suggests we need to optimize for higher-value conversions or improve our conversion funnel to increase average order value.
