title: Sample Document for PoC
content: |
  This is a sample document to test the AWS Bedrock ingestion pipeline.
  The document contains multiple lines of text to simulate real-world content.
  You can add additional paragraphs here to increase document size.
  Each paragraph can represent a chunk that will be embedded into the vector database.
  Metadata fields such as tenant_id, user_id, document_id, project_id, and thread_id
  are required for filtering and retrieval in queries.
  ---
  This is the second paragraph to simulate multiple chunks.
  Adding more sentences here helps test the text splitting functionality.
  The embedding should capture the semantic meaning of each chunk.
  This paragraph will also be stored in the `chunk_text` column.
  ---
  Final paragraph to complete the sample document.
  This ensures the ingestion Lambda handles multiple chunks correctly.
  Once ingested, you should see multiple rows in the `document_chunks` table
  with corresponding embeddings and metadata.
