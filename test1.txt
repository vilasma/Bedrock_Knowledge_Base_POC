Pacing Definition and Formula (Fixed)

Definition:
Pacing is the process of measuring how actual spend compares to the planned budget over a given period.
It ensures campaigns spend evenly and efficiently across the campaign duration â€” avoiding under-spending (risking lost opportunities) or over-spending (exceeding the budget too early).

Formula:
Pacing (%) = (Actual Spend Ã· Planned Spend) Ã— 100
Planned Spend = (Total Budget Ã· Campaign Duration in Days) Ã— Days Elapsed
Daily Planned Spend = Total Budget Ã· Campaign Duration in Days

Examples
Example 1 â€“ Under-Pacing
â€ƒâ€ƒTotal Budget = $120,000
â€ƒâ€ƒCampaign Duration = 90 days
â€ƒâ€ƒDaily Planned Spend = $120,000 Ã· 90 = $1,333
â€ƒâ€ƒActual Spend = $1,050
â€ƒâ€ƒPacing = (1,050 Ã· 1,333) Ã— 100 â‰ˆ 79% â†’ Under-pacing

Example 2 â€“ Over-Pacing
â€ƒâ€ƒPlanned Daily Spend = $1,333
â€ƒâ€ƒActual Spend = $1,500
â€ƒâ€ƒPacing = (1,500 Ã· 1,333) Ã— 100 â‰ˆ 113% â†’ Over-pacing

Example 3 â€“ On Pace
â€ƒâ€ƒPlanned Daily Spend = $1,333
â€ƒâ€ƒActual Spend = $1,333
â€ƒâ€ƒPacing = (1,333 Ã· 1,333) Ã— 100 = 100% â†’ On pace

Example 4 â€“ Acceptable Range
â€ƒâ€ƒPlanned daily spend range = $1,200 to $1,460
â€ƒâ€ƒActual Spend = $1,333
â€ƒâ€ƒPacing = (1,333 Ã· 1,333) Ã— 100 = â‰ˆ 90%â€“110% â†’ Acceptable Range

Interpretation Summary:
â€ƒâ€ƒ< 90%: Under-pacing â†’ Spending too slowly
â€ƒâ€ƒ90â€“110%: On track â†’ Spending as planned
â€ƒâ€ƒ> 110%: Over-pacing â†’ Spending too quickly

User: Can you write a short summary of how my campaigns are pacing in Oct 2025?
Agent:

Based on the October 2025 data and the pacing formula from brand artifacts, here's your campaign pacing summary:

## October 2025 Campaign Pacing Summary (As of Oct 6, 2025)
**Data Sources: Query Tool + Brand Artifacts (Pacing Definition)**

### Pacing Calculation
- **Days Elapsed**: 6 days (Oct 1-6)
- **Actual Spend**: $2,860
- **Planned Spend for 6 days**: $6,522 (6 days Ã— $1,087/day target)
- **Pacing**: ($2,860 Ã· $6,522) Ã— 100 = **44%**

### Pacing Status: ðŸš¨ **Severely Under-Pacing**
**Interpretation**: < 90% = Under-pacing (you're at 44%)

### Current Performance:
- **Daily average**: $477/day vs. target of $1,087/day
- **Shortfall**: $610/day behind target
- **Days remaining**: 25 days to correct course

### Performance Metrics:
- **Revenue**: $5,330
- **Conversions**: 39
- **CPA**: $73.33 (47% over $50 target)
- **ROAS**: 1.86:1 (well below 4:1 target)

### Action Required:
With 25 days remaining, need to increase daily spend to ~$1,344/day to hit monthly targets and improve campaign efficiency to meet KPI goals.
